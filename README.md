In order to be able to analyze and forecast the iron ore market more accurately, the internship unit sent two researchers from the Steel Industry Research Institute to explore the factors influencing the price changes of imported iron ore, in order to seek a better analysis of the iron ore market and help the group leaders to better give reasonable orders. The researchers found that the price of imported iron ore is often inextricably linked to factors such as futures market prices, the US dollar price index, and the supply and demand pattern of strong demand and insufficient supply.
